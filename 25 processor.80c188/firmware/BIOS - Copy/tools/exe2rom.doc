Name:
        EXE2ROM.EXE

Purpose:
        Create a burnable EPROM image file from a DOS linked
executable.  The .EXE file is subject to certain restrictions, but 
OBJ modules may be assembled / compiled by multiple utilities.

Usage:
        exe2rom [options] biosfile.exe romimage.bin

Options:
        -v      Verbose output
        -s      Startup file (default is STARTUP.BIN)
        -r NNN  size of the ROM <= size of the EPROM
        -e NNN  size of the physical EPROM

The startup file is an absolute binary file located at the highest
memory addresses on an Intel 80C188.  Execution begins at FFFF:0000,
which must contain a far JMP to the beginning of the ROM image at
SSSS:0000 (SSSS==0F000h for a 64K ROM, 0F800h for a 32K ROM, etc.).
