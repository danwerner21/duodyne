The following patches are required for the v1.00 6809 board prior to running:
•	Pin 33 of U2 (the CPU) must be tied high.  I used a 1K resistor to +5 on Pin 7 of the CPU
•	The Traces to Pins 7 and 8 on U9 (Address Decoder) need to be cut on the top of the board
•	Pin 7 of U9  needs to be connected to pin 4 of U19
•	Pin 8 of U9 needs to be connected to pin 7 of U19
•	patch Pin 19 of U9 to  Pin 3 of U2
